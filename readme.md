## About geoStudy

- Remote sensing is the process of detecting and monitoring the physical traits of an area by measuring its reflected and emitted radiation at a distance from the targeted area. It is the acquisition of information about an object without making any physical contact with it. The data used in remote sensing can be categorized based on their resolution, electromagnetic spectrum, energy source, imaging media and number of bands. We decided to extract features like vegetation, water and built-up using the different indices like NDVI, NDWI and NDBI.

- We decided to make a software that can be used calculate different features from satellite imagery. The software allows you to select raster imagery and find as well as compare the changes in different indices over a period of time. The software can also be used to study the effect of change in vegetation, water and built-up on Land Surface Temperature of the selected region.
